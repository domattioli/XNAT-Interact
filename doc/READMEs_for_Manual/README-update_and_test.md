# `update_and_test.py` Overview

## Purpose

The `update_and_test.py` file is designed to automate the process of updating the project dependencies and running tests to ensure that the project is functioning correctly after the updates. This script helps maintain the project's stability and compatibility with the latest versions of its dependencies via the github repository located at:
   `https://github.com/domattioli/XNAT-Interact/`


## Key Components

- **Dependency Update**: The script updates the project's dependencies to their latest versions on the repository.
- **Testing**: The script runs the project's test suite to verify that all functionalities are working as expected after the updates.

## How It Works

1. **Update Dependencies**:
   - The script uses a package manager (e.g., `pip`) to update the project's dependencies to their latest versions.
   - It ensures that the `requirements.txt` file is up-to-date with the latest versions of the dependencies.

2. **Run Tests**:
   - The script runs the project's test suite using a testing framework (e.g., `pytest`).
   - It verifies that all tests pass successfully, indicating that the project is functioning correctly with the updated dependencies.

## Usage

To use the `update_and_test.py` script, simply run it from the command line:

```sh
python [update_and_test.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/1)
